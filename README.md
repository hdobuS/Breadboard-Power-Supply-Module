# Breadboard-Power-Supply-Module
A breadboard power supply module is a compact PCB that steps down and regulates a higher DC input voltage (7â€“12V) into commonly used logic voltages (5V &amp; 3.3V). It plugs directly into a breadboard and can power both rails simultaneously, simplifying prototyping without bulky adapters or multiple power sources.
